# Toasty Neovim Config
Just run ```:PlugInstall``` and neovim should do the rest. Everything works on Windows 11 with GCC installed, however I have had trouble compiling parsers with treesitter on Windows 10.
If any issues with treesitter occurs, try using the Zig compiler instead of GCC. Everything should work just fine on Linux and MacOS.
