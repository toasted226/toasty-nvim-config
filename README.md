# Toasty Neovim Config
Just run ```:PlugInstall``` and neovim should do the rest. Everything works on Windows 11 with GCC installed, however I have had trouble compiling parsers with treesitter on Windows 10.
If any issues with treesitter occur, try using the Zig compiler instead of GCC. Everything should work just fine out of the box on Linux and MacOS.
